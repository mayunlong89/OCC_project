Integrative genomics analysis identifies risk genes associated with oral cancer susceptibility based on multi-omics data

# Background
Oral cavity cancer (OCC) is one of the most common carcinoma diseases. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported a number of genetic loci associated with oral cancer susceptibility. However, the regulatory mechanisms of these genetic variants underlying OCC remain largely unclear.

# Aim
By combining GWAS summary statistics (N = 4,151) with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) across 49 different tissues from the GTEx database, we performed an integrative genomics analysis to uncover novel risk genes associated with OCC.
